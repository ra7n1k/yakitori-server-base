# Yakitori Server Base
It's a plugin for *Yakitori Server*.
Send a message to logged-in players and distribute items to players who log in for the first time.

Releases are available to everyone, but they were built for Yakitori Server, so messages include the server name.
If you want to use it on your server, we recommend that you build it yourself.
