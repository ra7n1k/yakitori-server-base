# A Spigot plugin for *Yakitori Server*.
Send a message to logged-in players and distribute items to players who log in for the first time.

It's available to everyone, but it was built for *Yakitori Server*, so messages include the server name.
If you want to use it on your server, we recommend that you build it yourself.
